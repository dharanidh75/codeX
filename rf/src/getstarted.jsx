        and automates the tracking of contributions from various services,   
        including LeetCode, college portal which are typically managed manually  
        and disconnectedly. A key feature is a browser extension that automatically  
        collects data from thes platforms and feeds it to a central dashboard in   
        real time system allows teams to set goals, monitor individual and collective   
        progress, and gain a clear, unified view of everyone's achievements.  
        By eliminating the need for manual tracking and providing transparent   
        visibility into performance, TEAMCODEX aims to boost motivation,   
        enhance productivity, and foster a more collaborative and efficient coding environment.  
        It is a web-based platform designed to solve the problem of scattered progress data.  
        It provides a dedicated space where students and coding teams can connect, manage projects,  
        and monitor their collective and individual progress. By acting as a single source of truth,  
        it helps everyone on the team stay aligned and informed without needing to manually check multiple websites.
